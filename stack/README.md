## Array-based and LinkedList-based implementation for STL Stack
### Overview
Stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where new item is placed (pushed) and removed (popped) at the top of stack.
### Main Interface
* `bool isEmpty() const`
- Array-based: O(1)
- Linked-based: O(1)
* `bool push(const T& item)`
- Array-based: O(1)
- Linked-based: O(1)
* `bool pop()`
- Array-based: O(1)
- Linked-based: O(1)
* `T peek() const`
- Array-based: O(1)
- Linked-based: O(1)
